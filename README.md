# Face-Recognition 
Face Recognition using KNN algorithm and open cv for python.
## Breakdown of the code for KNN classifier
    1. Importing libraries
    2. Create some data for classification
    3. Write the kNN workflow
    4. Finally, run knn on the data and observe results
## Dependencies
    Python 2.7 and OpenCv
## How it works!
* Run generating selfie training data.ipynb.The script will open a camera window.Stand in front of the camera until recording of the face is completed.Input the person's name. Press q after having enough samples.
* The default file where the features are stored is name.npy.
* Run the Building Face Classifier.ipynb file!
